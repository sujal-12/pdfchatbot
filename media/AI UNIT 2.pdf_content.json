    "summary": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence, highlighting their importance in problem-solving. It categorizes search algorithms into Uninformed (Blind) and Informed (Heuristic) searches, detailing various algorithms such as Breadth-first Search (BFS), Depth-first Search (DFS), Depth-Limited Search (DLS), Uniform-cost Search (UCS), Iterative Deepening Depth-first Search (IDDFS), Bidirectional Search, A* Search, Greedy Best-first Search, and Hill Climbing. For each algorithm, it explains its mechanism, advantages, disadvantages, and properties like completeness, optimality, time complexity, and space complexity, often accompanied by illustrative examples. The document also introduces Heuristic techniques as methods for faster, approximate problem-solving and delves into Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), defining their components and types of constraints.",
